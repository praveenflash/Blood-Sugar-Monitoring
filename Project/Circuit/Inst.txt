* In ADC 0808 , pins A B C determines the input port.... Since its all are set to 0 port IN0 is selected.... ADC 0808 is a 8 bit IC... so it gives values from 0-256 as output.... Reference voltages (V- and V+) determines the range of output voltage.... Here we set V- as 2V and V+ as 5V...
Therefore, we set the set size of output voltage as ((V+)-(V-))/256 = 7.8125mV......  Also for the glucometer, we set 50mg/dL as lowest readable value and 300mg/dL as highest readable value.... Therefore, we get the accuracy corresponding to ADC 0808 as (300-50)/256=0.9765mg/dL.... 

* ADC 0808 requires clock to work... Since we use 11 Mhz clk freq for the microcontroller, we cannot use it for ADC.. ADC cannot operate at such high freq...... Hence we use clock dividin network to reduce the clk freq and use it for ADC..... In tat clk didvidin network 4 D-Flip flops are used.... For D-Flip flops the o/p ll b half of the input freq.... Since four is used the clk input given is scaled down by 2^4 factor.... Thus 11/(2^4) is the clk i/p to ADC0808....

* In ADC , The ALE pin (Address Latch Enable) is used to store the input port address currently used.... SC(Start Conversion ) pin when set to 1 makes ADC to sample its i/p.... EOC(End of Conversion) pin when it becomes high, it denotes that the samplin is complete... then we make the OE(Output Enable) pin to 1 to take the o/p from D0-D7 and give it as input to the micro controller P! as input.... The o/p of micro controller is given to HT12E (Encoder), which encodes only 4 bit at a time and sends it to its counter part HT12D(Decoder) via the RF module.... Both HT12E and HT12D operates synchronously.... First dey chk whether their addres lines are the same and den they chk whether the data sent by encoder is same as the one received by the decoder.... All these actions are performed three times.... Finally at the decoder the Valid Transmission (VT) pin is enabled indicating that the data is ready to be sent to the computer....
